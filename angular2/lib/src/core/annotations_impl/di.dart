 * Specifies that a constant attribute value should be injected.

 * The directive can inject constant string literals of host element attributes.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Suppose we have an `<input>` element and want to know its `type`.
 *
 * ```html
 * <input type="text">
 * ```
 *
 * A decorator can inject string literal `text` like so:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * @Directive({
 *   selector: `input'
 * })
 * class InputDirective {
 *   constructor(@Attribute('type') type) {
 *     // type would be `text` in this example
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

    // so we use instance of Attribute instead. This doesn't matter much in practice as arguments

    // with @Attribute annotation are injected by ElementInjector that doesn't take tokens into
